# Section Library Importer
## Imports section library templates

## Note
This module currently creates empty sections, blocks need to be added per page, per section ('Add Block' button). The CSS styling modifications made to a given section are kept imported.

## Adding new Templates
Navigate to the admin/config/content/layout_library_exporter page

Select which layout needs to be exported using the dropdown

Add layout thumbnail to the resources folder of this module

Set the filename for the template to the image intended to be used as its thumbnail by changing "INSERT FILENAME"

To the 'section_lib_importer.install' file add a new update function `section_lib_importer_update_N()` where N is the Drupal and module version, i.e. 8201 for Drupal 8.2, module version 0.1

Add exported array text into an array, multiple exported templates/sections can be added to this array, separated by commas, and pass it to the function `addSectionTemplates()`

New layouts will be added after the site is updated, ie. `drush updatedb`

### Example:
This update adds 'One Column Layout' and 'Two Column Layout' that are provided with installation of this module.

New layouts must use unique labels, duplicated labels will be ignored.

Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>"]]]]],
